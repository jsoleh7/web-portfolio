    <h3>About Journey</h3>
    <p> In my adventure to finding my career, I have dabbled in many areas such as mathematics, graphic design, and kinesiology. Through all my interests, I found that I loved anything that challenged me to create, solve, or construct something. In 2021, I came across coding for the first time and was instantly intrigued at all the potential and opportunity this field could open for me.  The excitement of coding allows me to articulate my thought process and carry out a creative solution. </p>

<p>Finding the Thinkful program has allowed me to take the next steps to advancing my career as a software developer.</p>

<p>If you need a new developer, or would like to just send me cat memes, I would be delighted to hear from you. I am excited to expand my network and work with, learn from, and build new relationships with other developers. </p>
